# ECE 508 Project

This code uses tkinter to make GUI that can be used to draft lithography masks used in the process of creating semiconductors.

## Libraries Used

This code uses tkinter, PIL, os, and random modules to facilitate it functionality. While tkinter, os, and random come with python, PIL does not and needs to be installed to be used. To install PIL, simply type the following command into the terminal.

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## How to use the code as is

Once all of the required dependencies have been installed, you can run the code. To do this, run the 'main.py' file from the parent directory of the 'src' directory. For example, if the parent directory of the project was called 'example', then you would open a terminal, navigate to the directory 'example', and run the following command on the terminal.

```bash
python3 src/main.py
```
